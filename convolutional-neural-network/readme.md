# Convolutional Neural Network

## Overview

The aim is to design a simple convolutional Neural Network using `TensorFlow`. The tutorial is aimed to sketch a starup model to the the two follwing:

1. Define an organization for the network architecture, training and evaluation phases.
2. Provides a template framework for constructing larger and more complicated models.

## Model Architecture

Two simple `convolutional layers`(each have max pooling) followed by two `fully-cnnected` layers conisdered. The number of output units for the last fully-connected layer is equal to the number of `classes` becasue a `softmax` has been implemented for the classification task.

## Code Organization

The source code is embeded in `code` folder.
