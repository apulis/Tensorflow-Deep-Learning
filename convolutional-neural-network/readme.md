# Convolutional Neural Network

##Overview

The aim is to design a simple convolutional Neural Network using `TensorFlow`. The tutorial is aimed to sketch a starup model to the the two follwing:
  1- Highlights a canonical organization for network architecture, training and evaluation.
  2- Provides a template for constructing larger and more sophisticated models.
